<h1>VirtualBox 7.0 setup on Ubuntu 22.04</h1>
<p>I have never encoutered so many errors while trying to run virtualbox, until today, so to make it painless, I will add a method here which should work.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Please disable the Secureboot one, you can work around by installing more drivers but better to avoid problem for now</li>
<li>As usual the upgrade and update step</li>

````
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 
````

</ul>
</p>

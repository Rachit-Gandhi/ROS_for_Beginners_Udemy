<h1>ROS Setup</h1>

<br>
Well I will be using Virtualbox with ubuntu 20.04 as my current machine is xubuntu 22.04, but can't use ROS Noetic with same.
I will try to share the machine with setup too so you can use same, directly from the repo.

ROS Noetic Installation is simple and can be done quick by following the [link](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

After that you may want to proceed to make a ROS Workspace which is illustrated in this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)

We are following Anis Koubaa's course so [his github](https://github.com/aniskoubaa?tab=repositories) is listed here and suggested by him we can clone the [GITHUB repo for this course](https://github.com/aniskoubaa/ros_essentials_cpp) from there.

<p> Please complete the above tasks to complete all tutorials. </p>
